# React Flow starter (Vite + TS)

We've put together this template to serve as a starting point for folks
interested in React Flow. You can use this both as a base for your own React
Flow applications, or for small experiments or bug reports.


Vite is a great development server and build tool that we recommend our users to
use. You can start a development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```
